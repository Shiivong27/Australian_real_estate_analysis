# Australian_real_estate_analysis
In this project, I have collated data from different government sources to create an overall picture of the real estate in Australia. The project analyses various suburbs in the Australian market, especially the Melbourne market and figures out which are some of the best suburbs in Melbourne with the best lifestyle, low-criminal rate and reasonable real estate. 

There is also a lot of Data Wrangling performed to mould the data into the format needed for side-by-side analysis. Reshaping data and Analysis have also been two important aspects of this project. 

The various steps used in the project have been explained in detail in the Jupyter Notebook.

Python packages used :

- pandas
- numpy
- datetime
- DBF
- shapefile
- pycrs
- matplotlib
- math
- scikitlearn
